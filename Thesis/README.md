# Detecting Anomalies in Social Media #

This paper aims to detect anomalies in target social media accounts. Previous work on behalf of this topic includes bot detection applications with different types of methods. However, Anomaly detection is a more general framework that encapsulates social bots. Capturing anomalies starts with specifying possible anomaly types that can be seen in social media. In this study we covered collective and point anomaly detection types targeting Twitter. Our algorithm includes features extracted from Twitter and synthetically created features

This study is not completed yet. Therefore I didn't published any of my findings in public. I will publish my paper at the end of December 22'.
