In Machine Learning This is an introductory machine learning course that will aim a solid understanding of the fundamental issues in machine learning together with several ML techniques such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, Bayesian classifiers, neural networks, linear and logistic regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, SVM and ensemble techniques. Some more theoretical aspects such as inductive bias and VC dimension will also covered. I finished a project that simulates Natural Selection environment that includes prey & predator agents that learn using DDPG algorithm in Reinforcement Learning.(SabancÄ± Univer
