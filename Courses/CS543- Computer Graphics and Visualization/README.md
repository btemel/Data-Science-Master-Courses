This course provides a study of computer graphics representation schemes and rendering algorithms such as advanced methods for representing, displaying, and rendering two- and three-dimensional scenes, general algebraic curves and surfaces, splines, Gaussian and bump-function representations, fractals, particle systems, constructive solid geometry methods, lighting models, radiosity, advanced ray-tracing methods, surface texturing, animation techniques data visualization methods.

I finished a project that implements a SP-GAN to human dataset. Creating 3D meshes from point clouds. (Sabancı University 21’)
